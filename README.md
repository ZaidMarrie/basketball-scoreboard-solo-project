# Basketball Scoreboard (Solo Project Solution)

This is my solution to the [Basketball Scoreboard Solo Project on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/solo-project-basketball-scoreboard-cz9adVfP). The solo projects are part of the [Scrimba Platform's Courses](https://scrimba.com/allcourses).

## Overview

### The challenge

You are required to do the following:

- Build the site from scratch
- Follow the design
- Make all six buttons work

The following is not required, but they are some stretch goals to take this project further:

- Add a "Start New Game" button.
- Highlight the leading score.
- Add a few more counters (e.g. period, fouls, timer).
- Change the design.

### Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

### Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
